    paragraph: "The challenges of life are unique and anyone from us could be accommodated with a sudden and unwanted crises. Moreover, in a country like ours, there is a monotonous path that many follow where there are just deprived of the basic amenities in life. It is needless to mention about the importance of accessible education and healthcare for all. Though the necessities are more, education coupled with healthcare are primarily the only services that can draw a line between life and death.

The task at hand is huge and in order to achieve our mission to make the poor educated and free from ailments requires the support of everyone for which we are always looking for support and assistance in howsoever small form it may be."

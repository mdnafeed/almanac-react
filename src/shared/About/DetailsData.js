We work on behalf of millions of people living here in India with our unmatched scope of initiatives that we undertake to provide the underprivileged all the support that is required to fulfill the obligations in either securing basic education and/or medical treatments.",

      "With education and healthcare programs like educational scholarships and fellowships, medical prevention, early detection, clinical research, innovation and advocacy, no charitable organization impacts more lives than ASW. We sincerely believe that each and every individual in the world is entitled to free education and healthcare facilities without exceptions. With many countries, especially in the West, having been able to achieve the same to a certain extent through government policies and programs, challenges in a developing country like India are unique. Despite the improvement in the education sector over the years along with technological advancements in healthcare, the biggest challenge posed to the people is to sustain one's own daily necessities. This leads a major section of our country deprived of such basic facilities. Almanac Social Welfare remains committed to the welfare of people from the most impoverished strata of society without distinction of caste, creed or color. We intend to ensure a society comprised of educated and healthy citizens.",

We intend to scale up and establish several Almanac Social Welfare centers in the years to come and these will certainly be setup in the most rural sections of the country. Despite the infrastructure, we also have huge plans to use the latest technology so as to ensure no individual remains deprived of educational and health care facilities."

    p: "In a competitive world like ours where every action is done for material's sake, running a nonprofit organization was never something I dreamt doing. All I thought of was to be extremely successful in my career just like how any individual thinks today. All that changed when I consciously started learning that necessities like food, clothing, shelter, education, healthcare that was at my disposal in a flash of a second, was actually something not-for-granted for more than half of the population, if not less. My conscious triggered to find a solution and with this Almanac's journey to dedicate a part of our lives to a social cause took birth."

    h: "I really hope that the profile of Almanac and its activities in regards to various free education and healthcare programs and initiatives delineated will give you a clear picture of the principles for which we stand and are actively working. I cannot enough emphasize how poverty has stripped people of the basic amenities and one of the ways I think to bring such people to mainstream is by ensuring free education and healthcare services. Desperate measures need to be taken for the underprivileged to build a culture of hope, trust and healthy relationship so as to help them to evolve the necessary skillset, confidence, thinking alongside good health which ensures that they in-turn take an active role in developing our communities. This obviously needs the active support of all kind-hearted volunteers like you to dedicate a part of your life and take responsibilities in view of the magnitude of the program. I strongly believe how much meager your contribution may be, it will only add to the whole to bring light and happiness to ones who are in the clutches of privation."

By understanding that there is no "one-size-fits-all" way of dealing with this problem, we customize our initiatives using a variety of models. What matters most for us is impact. We accept that no organization or entity alone can remove the complex barriers when it comes to healthcare due to income inequality. We have to work together with governments, corporations and other nonprofit organizations to achieve community-defined health goals.'

Although it is the basic right of every individual living on this planet, several people are deprived of it either due to the financial crises that they might be going through or due to the narrow mindset of the people living in rural areas. Education is a blessing for humankind as it plays a major role in shaping each person’s overall personality, developing new ideas, and opening various paths for choosing a career. It develops a perspective of looking at life. It helps us build opinions and have points of view on things in life."

    paragraph: "Schools play an important role in developing different skills in students. It is not only about the brand name of a school, but it is about the type of education that is provided in their schools. Going to school is much more about the grades and scores that one receives and what one learns in the textbooks, it is about being able to interpret things. In reality, what matters is the introduction to different skills & extra curriculum activities that students are involved in. It is only then one will enjoy attending the school as well as pay equal attention to their grades. All of this comes down to the ‘interests’ of the students, children tend to lose interest or focus when they are mistreated by the teachers. As it is often said, teachers are the second mothers who play a vital role in uniquely delivering quality education. They make the students recognize their worth and the potential that they perceive within and encourage them to give outstanding performance in all walks of life."

Poverty has far more dimensions that includes low access to opportunities for either developing human capital or education. This is termed as human poverty. The human poverty is a comprehensive term when compared to income poverty as it also looks out for a denial of selections and opportunities in order to live an efficient life. To put it simply, poverty needs to be understood as a deprivation of opportunities that lead to improvement in the human skills and abilities."

This will be done through a system that works alongside different stakeholders at all levels and with effective coordination, we implement and monitor our education programmes. We also aim to reduce the number of out of school needy children by timely enrolment, regular attendance and flexible learning. We also look out to support to strengthen life skills development. These soft skills will allow children to be a part of mainstream that is very dynamic in the Indian societal context. We also intend to give special focus on education for girls. We have also opened our doors for all those who would like to give an attempt in clearing the exams conducted by the public netwrok commission so that they could in turn contribute back to the society."

    paragraph: "Needless to mention that the impact of poverty on education is an imperative area essential for the progress and development of not only individuals but that of the society, and consequently, nation. The individuals residing in the conditions of poverty often face a number of impediments within the course of acquisition of education. India’s literacy rate is around 74% which leaves a quarter of the people without basic reading and writing skills. While around 22% of Indians fall below the poverty line, it has been estimated that more than half of the country's population lacks even the basic literacy skills. Though education is a constitutional right, its provision falls well below an appropriate standard. The Government is well aware of the problems that the people face in giving students an adequate standard education, but they have been extremely slow in responding to these problems. Believe it or not, most of the underprivileged students cannot afford to go to a school or a college. The schemes we have often heard from different political parties that have ruled the country are to be questioned for their efficacy. Also, millions of rupees spent to subsidize education for the poor have only benefited the rich because the poor still find education unaffordable and are often forced to drop out. Furthermore, the additional cost for uniforms, textbooks, teacher salaries and school maintenance take a toll on the families. Lastly, these are surface-level problems though in reality the issues run far deeper. In such a predicament, the need of the hour is that our education system becomes poor-friendly and for this, the government needs to come up with mega-scale need-based grant programmes that would take care of the basic living as well as education expense."

    paragraph: "Let’s absorb the stats first that will set the premise for which Almanac Social Welfare stands. According to articles 'Insured yet vulnerable: out-of-pocket payments and India’s poor' and 'The impoverishing effect of healthcare payments in India: new methodology and findings', each year around 150 million people globally face financial catastrophe due to spending on health—and according to a study done in 2010, more than one third of them live in India. The number of Indians falling below the poverty line due to health spending may run as high as 63 million people. This will almost be 7 percent of India's population. To make matters worse, these numbers are only on the rise. According to the Indian Ministry of Health, 18 percent of households faced catastrophic health costs in 2011-12 as compared to 15 percent in 2004-05. The vast majority of healthcare-related impoverishment takes place in rural areas, and occurs in the context of outpatient care."

    paragraph: "The dependency on the private sector to cater to the healthcare needs of the people has also not solved problems of the Indian population. High health expenses steered 55 million Indians into poverty in 2011-12 which is more than the population of South Korea, Spain or Kenya. Also, according to a new study, 38 million (69%) were impoverished by expenditure on medicines alone. In India, outpatient care is extortionate. The reality stems out from the cause that 76 percent of Indians do not have health insurance. It is very disheartening to write that 7 percent of Indians fall below the poverty line just because of indebtedness due to health expenses. This figure hasn’t changed in a decade. As a result, around 23 percent of sick cannot afford healthcare."

    paragraph: "If one looks at the root cause for such a depressing situation, one would have to say that it is because of the low public investment in health. In the face of the fact that the Supreme Court of India has declared healthcare to be a fundamental right in the constitution, historical public spending of a little above a percent of the GDP has ensured that the country’s healthcare needs remain underserved and left for the private sector to netwrok. According to the WHO, India ranks very low out of 191 countries in terms of percent-of-GDP spending on health. When the same is compared with Sri Lanka, China and Thailand, all invest three to four times more per capita. The fundamental aspect of healthcare declared by the Supreme Court is indeed in shambles."

We currently organize, manage and facilitate several healthcare programs to provide a one-stop access to high-quality primary healthcare services. Our aim is to provide early detection & treatment of illnesses, preventive care which ultimately reduces long-term health costs for the impoverished. We include services like doctor consultation, medicines, diagnostics and day-care procedures. We deliberately try to choose days and time so that people do not have to miss their work whilst taking our services. From our early days, we have adhered to the use of technology and this helps us track and monitor our efforts at all levels."

    description1: `Education is an important and essential part of everyone's life. Although it is the basic right of every individual living on this planet, several people are deprived of it either due to the financial crises that they might be going through or due to the narrow mindset of the people living in rural areas. Education is a blessing for humankind as it plays a major role in shaping each person’s overall personality, developing new ideas, and opening various paths for choosing a career. It develops a perspective of looking at life. It helps us build opinions and have points of view on things in life.`,
    description2:
      "Schools play an important role in developing different skills in students. It is not only about the brand name of a school, but it is about the type of education that is provided in their schools. Going to school is much more about the grades and scores that one receives and what one learns in the textbooks, it is about being able to interpret things. In reality, what matters is the introduction to different skills & extra curriculum activities that students are involved in. It is only then one will enjoy attending the school as well as pay equal attention to their grades. All of this comes down to the ‘interests’ of the students, children tend to lose interest or focus when they are mistreated by the teachers. As it is often said, teachers are the second mothers who play a vital role in uniquely delivering quality education. They make the students recognize their worth and the potential that they perceive within and encourage them to give outstanding performance in all walks of life.",
    description3:
      "Therefore, education must be accessible to all as everyone deserves to be educated. It is the first early investment for child development. Governments and nations, must plan for the best education infrastructure in schools and colleges equally for the people in rural areas as Nelson Mandela once said, “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”",
    description4:
      "Knowledge is power and learning throughout the lifetime is means of growing with every ounce of knowledge that you seek. However, in this century with the advancement of technology & when quality education is readily available, some children might lose their interest in the middle of this journey or when they are in doubt when choosing a specific career path. But one must remember that it is due to the academic credentials, one is confident enough to work in any of the corporate sectors or organizations that they are willing to work in. sometimes, it is only due to the educational background one can pursue their dreams and aspirations.",
    description5:
      "Teachers must be skilled in different modes and techniques to deliver knowledge so that they develop their interests. Students should not just be burdened with the amount of homework that they are obliged to complete, with the help of good teacher’s students will enjoy coming to schools. Often, teachers are the ones assisting the students when choosing career paths or be it making decisions for their life. They are the role models and mentors that the students look up to.",

    description1: `'Mere scarcity of resources' is just one aspect of understanding poverty. This definition refers to income poverty. Poverty has far more dimensions that includes low access to opportunities for either developing human capital or education. This is termed as human poverty. The human poverty is a comprehensive term when compared to income poverty as it also looks out for a denial of selections and opportunities in order to live an efficient life. To put it simply, poverty needs to be understood as a deprivation of opportunities that lead to improvement in the human skills and abilities.`,
    description2:
      "Almanac Social Welfare through its various scholarship programs is working closely in different societies to make sure all aspirants, particularly the most disadvantaged, participate in quality early childhood and elementary education with learning outcomes. This will be done through a system that works alongside different stakeholders at all levels and with effective coordination, we implement and monitor our education programmes. We also aim to reduce the number of out of school needy children by timely enrolment, regular attendance and flexible learning. We also look out to support to strengthen life skills development. These soft skills will allow children to be a part of mainstream that is very dynamic in the Indian societal context. We also intend to give special focus on education for girls. We have also opened our doors for all those who would like to give an attempt in clearing the exams conducted by the public netwrok commission so that they could in turn contribute back to the society.",
    description3: `Needless to mention that the impact of poverty on education is an imperative area essential for the progress and development of not only individuals but that of the society, and consequently, nation. The individuals residing in the conditions of poverty often face a number of impediments within the course of acquisition of education. India’s literacy rate is around 74% which leaves a quarter of the people without basic reading and writing skills. While around 22% of Indians fall below the poverty line, it has been estimated that more than half of the country's population lacks even the basic literacy skills. Though education is a constitutional right, its provision falls well below an appropriate standard. The Government is well aware of the problems that the people face in giving students an adequate standard education, but they have been extremely slow in responding to these problems. Believe it or not, most of the underprivileged students cannot afford to go to a school or a college. The schemes we have often heard from different political parties that have ruled the country are to be questioned for their efficacy. Also, millions of rupees spent to subsidize education for the poor have only benefited the rich because the poor still find education unaffordable and are often forced to drop out. Furthermore, the additional cost for uniforms, textbooks, teacher salaries and school maintenance take a toll on the families. Lastly, these are surface-level problems though in reality the issues run far deeper. In such a predicament, the need of the hour is that our education system becomes poor-friendly and for this, the government needs to come up with mega-scale need-based grant programmes that would take care of the basic living as well as education expense.`,

    title: "Healthcare in India – Is it really healthy and caring?",
    description1: `Let’s absorb the stats first that will set the premise for which Almanac Social Welfare stands. According to articles 'Insured yet vulnerable: out-of-pocket payments and India’s poor' and 'The impoverishing effect of healthcare payments in India: new methodology and findings', each year around 150 million people globally face financial catastrophe due to spending on health—and according to a study done in 2010, more than one third of them live in India. The number of Indians falling below the poverty line due to health spending may run as high as 63 million people. This will almost be 7 percent of India's population. To make matters worse, these numbers are only on the rise. According to the Indian Ministry of Health, 18 percent of households faced catastrophic health costs in 2011-12 as compared to 15 percent in 2004-05. The vast majority of healthcare-related impoverishment takes place in rural areas, and occurs in the context of outpatient care.`,
    description2: `The dependency on the private sector to cater to the healthcare needs of the people has also not solved problems of the Indian population. High health expenses steered 55 million Indians into poverty in 2011-12 which is more than the population of South Korea, Spain or Kenya. Also, according to a new study, 38 million (69%) were impoverished by expenditure on medicines alone. In India, outpatient care is extortionate. The reality stems out from the cause that 76 percent of Indians do not have health insurance. It is very disheartening to write that 7 percent of Indians fall below the poverty line just because of indebtedness due to health expenses. This figure hasn’t changed in a decade. As a result, around 23 percent of sick cannot afford healthcare.`,
    description3: `If one looks at the root cause for such a depressing situation, one would have to say that it is because of the low public investment in health. In the face of the fact that the Supreme Court of India has declared healthcare to be a fundamental right in the constitution, historical public spending of a little above a percent of the GDP has ensured that the country’s healthcare needs remain underserved and left for the private sector to service. According to the WHO, India ranks very low out of 191 countries in terms of percent-of-GDP spending on health. When the same is compared with Sri Lanka, China and Thailand, all invest three to four times more per capita. The fundamental aspect of healthcare declared by the Supreme Court is indeed in shambles.`,
    description4: `Almanac Social Welfare has been working incessantly to plug this gap in the healthcare situation that exists. We currently organize, manage and facilitate several healthcare programs to provide a one-stop access to high-quality primary healthcare services. Our aim is to provide early detection & treatment of illnesses, preventive care which ultimately reduces long-term health costs for the impoverished. We include services like doctor consultation, medicines, diagnostics and day-care procedures. We deliberately try to choose days and time so that people do not have to miss their work whilst taking our services. From our early days, we have adhered to the use of technology and this helps us track and monitor our efforts at all levels.`,

    title: "Healthcare challenges in India: Lack of Awareness and Access",
    description1: `Though India has witnessed significant developments in the area of healthcare and health outcomes of its people, the system continues to face multiple challenges that include inadequate infrastructure, shortage of healthcare professionals, urban-rural disparities, limited health insurance coverage, etc. The most glaring of these challenges is unquestionably the urban-rural disparity in India. The progress is uneven across states, and demographic and epidemiological changes means, the country faces a double burden of diseases and an ageing population. India is grappling with a growing burden of non-communicable diseases, which poses a significant challenge to its healthcare system. While on one end we see glass structures delivering high-tech medicare to the well-heeled, mostly urban Indian, on the other end are the ramshackle outposts in the remote reaches of the rural India trying desperately to live up to their identity as health sub-centers, waiting to be transformed into a center delivering adequate care and wellness to its people. A well-functioning healthcare system provides high-quality healthcare services to the people, and it should be accessible, affordable, and sustainable. `,
    description2: `India has a mixed health-care delivery system consisting of a diverse and complex network of public and private sectors that provide a wide range of medical services to India's more than one billion population. The public sector includes primary, secondary, and tertiary care facilities managed by the central and state governments. Primary healthcare services are provided through primary health centers or community health centers where the patients need to contact first. District hospitals provide the secondary care services that focus on acute and specialist services. Advanced medical services, including specialty and super-specialty services provided by medical colleges refers to tertiary care services. The private sector consists of individual practitioners, nursing homes, clinics, and corporate hospitals.`,
    description3:
      "While there seems to be plenty of efforts from the system to deliver healthcare to the greater ‘real’ India in the form of various schemes/yojanas and adequate funding, e.g, National Health Mission (NHM), Ayushman Bharat Programme etc., there remain challenges in delivering healthcare to the socially disadvantaged, the economically challenged, and the systemically marginalized population. And there are reasons for this to know, understand and address to achieve what India wants to achieve in regards to healthcare and wellness.",
    description4: `The first and foremost reason is the awareness among Indian population regarding, first their own health, and two the healthcare services offered by the government to especially the rural and economically weaker population. Studies on awareness are diverse but the studies have shown that only one-third of antenatal mothers have adequate knowledge regarding antenatal care and breastfeeding practice. 11.3 percent of the adolescent girls studied knew correctly about key reproductive health issues in urban Haryana. Another study found that only 20.3% of people were aware of common causes of prevalent illness and their prevention in rural India. One can attribute this lack of awareness in India regarding healthcare to low educational status, poor functional literacy, lower education within the healthcare system, and low priority for health in the population.`,
    description5:
      "The right or opportunity to use or benefit from healthcare system defines the accessibility of receiving healthcare services. The issue stands relevant in India which is a combination of urban populations to the urban underprivileged, and the rural population which forms the major part of India and is also underprivileged in regards to receiving public healthcare services. Access is a complex notion that includes various aspects of availability, supply, and utilization of healthcare services as being factors in determining it and is influenced by a number of other factors in India, such as regional inequalities, socio-economic disparities, poor infrastructure, and cultural considerations. Physical reach is one of the basic determinants in the access of healthcare facilities. A study in India estimated that in rural areas, only 37% of people were able to access in-patient facilities within a 5 km distance, and 68% were able to access out-patient facilities. Hurdles to access in the financial, organizational and cultural domains affect the utilization of services, even in places where they are available.",
    description6:
      "While India has made great strides in recent years to increase access to healthcare, problems still exist, especially in rural and economically underdeveloped areas. Many of the primary health centers lacks basic infrastructural facilities such as beds, wards, toilets, drinking water facility, clean labor rooms for delivery, and regular electricity and even paramedical staff in rural areas. There is a marked disparity in the quality and accessibility of healthcare services between urban and rural areas. Urban areas tend to have better infrastructure, access to skilled professionals, and availability of specialized care, while rural areas often struggle with inadequate facilities and limited human resources.",
    description7:
      "To provide comprehensive and continued care access as well as awareness about such initiatives, the primary healthcare team should be entrusted with the responsibility and accountability for care and accessibility for a defined population. It would also help in promoting access to primary healthcare and also reduce the overall expenditure on healthcare, by reducing unnecessary referrals, by preventing illnesses, and by treating diseases at an earlier stage. However, the teams should have functional linkages with higher or secondary healthcare units. Also, creating and retaining healthcare professionals for rural primary healthcare is an important aspect as there is a lack of skilled healthcare professionals and physicians in the rural areas, because of which people have to look out to other healthcare units that ultimately increases the overall burden.",
    description8:
      "In rural areas, the health professionals need to provide a range of care, for a range of conditions to people across the life cycle. They therefore need to have a range of clinical, social and leadership skills. Current medical and nursing education is conducted in specialized tertiary care settings and is geared toward providing care in such settings only. Allocating a proportion of postgraduate seats to family medicine, with appropriate training in rural health care settings, will bring about the change in focus from tertiary care to primary care, and from urban bias to rural focus. It would require setting up family medicine programs in medical colleges with strong rural focus. Setting up a group to define improvements in training, and working conditions for rural healthcare professionals as well as spreading awareness to among local residents will be extremely helpful in overcoming healthcare challenges in rural areas.",
    description9:
      "To address these hurdles, it is crucial to enhance healthcare infrastructure, strengthen regulatory mechanisms, promote a culture of quality improvement and provide training on clinical governance. Sustained initiatives are required to improve the availability, affordability, and caliber of healthcare services. To reduce the gaps and attain universal and equitable healthcare in India, a complex strategy comprising policy interventions, investments, reforms, and community engagement is required. To improve healthcare access particularly in rural areas, Mobile Medical Units (MMUs) & Telemedicine should also be introduced at a larger scale.",

    titel3: `– Ban Ki-Moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations`,
    description1: `Though we constantly hear about the progress that India has achieved in terms of accessibility of education, does the number justify the number of what we call educated people in India in terms of performance and result? This is where the question of ‘Quality Education’ pops in. Providing quality education is a prime concern despite the many reforms in education system that India has seen in the last couple of decades. Poor quality education is leading to poor learning outcomes, ultimately pushing children out of the education system and leaving them vulnerable to child labour, abuse and violence. What National statistical data suggest is completely at odds with the progress in education system in India that we are hyping about.  Learning assessments illustrate that the majority of children in public schools lack the basics of literacy and numeracy or the additional knowledge and skills necessary for their all-round development as specified under the Right to Education Act. The gap in the accessibility and quality of education in urban and rural India is high owing to the reservation of just a small percentage of opportunities for the scheduled castes (SC), scheduled tribes (ST), backward classes (OBCs) and minority communities. No wonder states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh with large populations of children from scheduled castes (SC), scheduled tribes (ST), other backward classes (OBCs) and minority communities have the lowest performance. Much remains to be done to ensure that all children benefit from comprehensive and extensive classrooms that includes all and provides a child-friendly learning environment, as well as the availability of improved water, sanitation and hygiene.`,
    description3:
      "Successful results and performance are based on not a single but a wide range of factors and determinants which becomes wider in a culturally diverse country like India, especially where the socio-economic conditions vary significantly. Children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds often attend poorly funded schools with inadequate facilities and resources. Often children from economically weaker section in India have to work to support their families financially, which leads to either poor attendance/performance or these children in most cases drop out of school. ",
    description4:
      "The reasons and challenges for this is many, however, the most evident on the square reasons are the lack of infrastructure and resources in government funded schools. Lack of basic facilities like water, electricity and sanitation in rural areas add to problems and challenges that the school has to face. Apart from this, a lack of trained and qualified educators and the out of the ark fusty curriculum that are used also contribute to the poor quality of education in most schools in India.",
    description5:
      "According to a report by the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO), nearly one-third of the educators in India do not have the necessary qualifications to teach. This significantly impacts the quality of education as un-trained teachers are less equipped to deliver quality education to students. Additionally, many teachers lack adequate training in modern teaching techniques and cannot provide their students with an interactive and engaging learning experience. One of the main reasons is that the teacher himself is a product of the same education system that emphasizes on rote learning and memorization that leads to lack of critical thinking, creativity and problem solving skills which makes it difficult for students to apply what they learn in real-life situations.",
    description6:
      "The curriculum in many schools in India is outdated and is not updated regularly. These are based primarily on memorization rather than understanding or skill development. The existing curriculum in Indian schools lacks relevance to the changing times of real-world challenges and technological advancements. With the progress in digital era, the most government funded schools in India lack basic amenities like computers and practical-life learning. There is a pressing need to incorporate subjects like computer programming, artificial intelligence and practical life skills to the curriculum. What an irony it is, that one small section of the society is made to think that coding and computer programming is a must for a seven year old while failing to provide the basics of computers even in the secondary schools to the large economically weaker section!",
    description7:
      "To make reforms towards building economically productive, sustainable livelihoods, peaceful societies and enhanced individual well-being, the first and foremost requirement is to invest in providing facilities and infrastructure that correlates with the evolving times. The curriculum should be updated regularly to include interdisciplinary subjects, vocational training, and modern teaching methods. A curriculum that caters to holistic development and diverse career paths should be implemented. Online learning platforms, digital content and virtual classrooms can provide access to quality resources and enable personalized learning experiences. Integrating vocational training programs can offer diverse career paths and reduce the insistence on conventional academic options. Encouraging skill-based education and creativity equip students with practical knowledge that enhances their real-life problems solving skills.  To achieve sustainable development, government educational institutions can collaborate with industry to promote research and innovation and provide students with hands-on learning experiences through internships. ",
    description8:
      "For all of this to happen, teachers and educators need to play a crucial role in shaping and bringing reform. Investing in comprehensive teacher training programs, continuous professional development, and attracting the best talent to the teaching profession can significantly improve the learning experience for students. There is a need for providing awareness, ease and accessibility for the economically weaker section of the society to motivate them bridging the gap between the rural-urban India in terms of opportunities and disparities in the learning outcomes. Spreading awareness about the government programs and initiatives and proving ease in access to the rural India is still a challenge. ",

    description9:
      "For a nation to progress, education is the key that allow sustainable development goals to achieve. When people are able to get quality education, they can break from the cycle of poverty, gender and caste inequality and empower themselves to live more healthy and sustainable lives. Education is also crucial to fostering tolerance between people and contributes to more peaceful societies. The education system in India demands thoughtful reforms to address challenges in acquiring quality, accessibility, updated curriculum, educator training and the evolving needs of students and teachers with the changing times nurturing, life-skills, critical thinking, creativity and problem solving skills.",

    title: "The Market of Coaching Centers in India",
    description1: `It sounds perfectly normal in India if a five year old, after attending five hours of classes at school spends 2-3 hours in coaching/tuition classes daily burdening his shoulders to his parents’ already decided career choice of being a medical or an engineering professional. What is more frightening than the grueling school-tuition routine epidemic is when this five year old gets stuck with basic counting to 100, alphabets and phonics.`,
    description2:
      "India has become a ‘Tuition Republic’,a thriving industry born out of an indifferent rote learning-based school education system, parents’ unreasonable ambitions and a shrinking job market. According to a report, the current market revenue of the coaching industry in India is INR 58,088 crores. Its growth is projected to reach INR 1,33,995 crores by 2028. According to the data published by the National Sample Survey in 2016, there are INR 7.1 crores students enrolled in tuitions. However, this data has only increased at a full tilt after a two-year pandemic interruption with the digital platform and is now an inescapable part of urban India. As per the report from IBEF, India is the second largest market for e-education after the USA, as digitalization is growing and reaching every corner of the country. Data also suggests that a significant number of the trained educators have found employment elsewhere and taken up private training. Private mentors charge anything between INR 500 to INR 4000 every hour for each student depending upon the cities and subjects while multiple educational classes cost between INR 1000 to INR 6000 every month from a student.",
    description3:
      "While initially, coaching centers were supposed to provide special classes in sports, some subjects that a student has difficulty in understanding or any other extra-curricular skill development or activity, it has now become an integral part of learning or re-learning all the school subjects after school. The boom of coaching institutions all across India is also due to an increase in the success rate of students taking admission examinations for top colleges in India. The expansion of coaching market poses a serious question regarding the efficacy of school/educational institutions in India. The regular school education system in India suffers many limitations including poor infrastructure, lack of trained educators and outdated curriculums which leaves students unequipped to prepare for highly competitive examinations. However, the government did announce a major change in the education system through its New Education Policy (NEP), but awareness and accessibility is a long term exercise with India’s large gap in socio-economic sections. It is difficult to determine whether or not the coaching institutions in India represent a genuine necessity or just a trend.",
    description4:
      "In India, examinations like, JEE, NEET and Civil Services are standardized to get admissions in prestigious colleges and institutions. The coaching institutes provide students with methods and tools to clear these exams, mock tests, study guides as well as individual tutoring to focus on the areas of improvement, putting an extra emphasis on speed, accuracy and time management that are crucial to qualify these admission examinations. The advanced technologies and teaching strategies that are not available in conventional classrooms provide exposure to students with the new approaches to learning and understanding that is relevant with the ever-increasing and changing latest information. The students show better academic performance that helps them boost their confidence and self-esteem. The stress to perform better in school exams and clear the competitive examinations has led to the ‘Tuition Republic’ that we are witnessing with some cities emerging as coaching hubs. Data from the National Sample Survey Office’s 71st round survey reveal that more than a quarter of Indian students, over 70 million, take private coaching, and around 12 per cent of a family’s expenses go towards private coaching. No wonder there is a dramatic increase in mental health problems among young school students, and an increase rate of suicides among students who fail to qualify these examinations leaving their parents in a pool of debt. Due to the fact that most coaching institutes are situated in major cities, there is a challenge for the rural and low-income communities, first to shift or send their children to these cities and then to afford the cost associated with these institutions. This further widens the inequality and accessibility gap between who and who cannot afford private tutoring.",
    description5:
      "Despite the fact that these coaching institutes do help students to get through highly competitive examinations, it is appalling to know that most Indian parents think that tuitions and coaching institutes from an early age help their children to understand and improve knowledge which is not possible in even highly expensive private schools. This has put an immense financial strain on parents particularly those from low-income households, which actually make up the majority India, as coaching institutes are highly expensive leading to forced loan on coaching expenses owing to a burden that may not be realistic for most Indian families. All this has led to a highly competitive environment for top grades and admission to best schools which might not be healthy for young generation who aspires to learn and develop a ‘rat-race mentality’ in which the definition of success changes rapidly. There is also a rise in academic dishonesty with the rise in the demand to perform.",
    description6:
      "A student might get top grades and clear competitive examinations through enrolling themselves to coaching institutes, but the rote learning method based on memorization, learning tips and tricks, and studying just with an objective to prepare questions to qualify examinations might also leave students too reliant on exam-oriented learning. This develops a lack of critical thinking, creativity and real-life problem solving skills in most students. This also disregards that every person has its own learning pace and the standardized teaching approaches might not be suited to everyone.",
    description7:
      "The most disappointing fact is that this race has led to a drop in independent learning and discovering, abandoning reading classical books that forces one to think, analyze and contribute to the society with fresh ideas and perspectives. There has been also a decline in the participation in extracurricular and co-curricular activities that develops real-life skills in students. The overemphasis on most sought after career choices like engineering and medicine must not disregard each student’s unique quality and interests and the choices accessible to them which seems a distant dream in the current scenario.",
    description8:
      "While coaching institutes do play an important role in preparing students for various competitive examinations, or might make some students exam-ready, what is extremely baffling is to see primary children going to coaching/tuitions after school which totally invalidates the school learning. Have the primary schools or the schools in general just become a place for attendance, recreation and exams, or the coaching institutions become a status symbol? Why nowadays, which was not the case a couple of decades back, primary schools is not efficient in delivering basic learning and knowledge to the children? Why a small kid has to relearn the basics of literacy, numeracy and arithmetic? Whatever the reason, it would not be an exaggeration to say that coaching/tuition has become a thriving ‘dream selling’ industry in India. ",

    title: "The Prevalence of Waterborne Diseases in India",
    description1: `Water is essential for human survival. It is vital for life and makes up to 50-70 percent of our body weight. Healthy drinking water is also the linchpin of a country's economy. Though healthy and safe drinking water is a necessity, it's scarcity in developing countries has made it a luxury. With the boom of development and industrialization, water quality is facing severe challenges. Industrialization, urbanization and agricultural activities have polluted the environment adversely affecting the water bodies, i.e., rivers and oceans, necessary for life affecting human health and sustainable development. It has been reported that almost 80% of industrial and municipal wastewater is discharged into the environment without any prior treatment, with adverse effects on human health and ecosystems globally. This proportion is higher in developing countries like India, where sanitation and wastewater treatment facilities are poor. `,
    description2:
      "According to the reports, groundwater in one-third of India’s 600 districts is deemed unfit for drinking, with dangerous levels of toxic pollutants like fluoride, iron, salinity and arsenic. A World Resources Institute data suggests that an alarming 70 percent of India’s water supply is being extremely polluted. The United Nations also ranked India’s water quality at a horrifying 120th among 122 nations in the quality of water available for human consumption. This is inescapable when water gets polluted with industrial waste, human waste, animal waste, garbage, untreated sewage, chemical effluents, etc. Drinking or cooking with such polluted water leads to waterborne diseases and infections such as amoebiasis, giardiasis, and toxoplasmosis. This ultimately puts a strain on public healthcare, economic and sustainable development of the country. The economic burden in India is estimated USD 600 million per year because waterborne diseases affected one-third of the Indian population, especially in flood and drought-prone areas. In India, groundwater from over 30 million access points supplies drinking water to 85% of the rural and 48% of the urban population, thus making it indispensable to maintain groundwater quality.",
    description3:
      "Various toxic chemicals, organic and inorganic substances, toxic solvents and volatile organic chemicals may be released in industrial production through distillery industry, tannery industry, pulp and paper industry, textile industry, food industry, iron and steel industry, nuclear industry and so on. Arsenic, cadmium, and chromium are vital pollutants discharged in wastewater through the industrial sector. Pesticides, nitrogen fertilizers and organic farm wastes from agriculture are significant causes of water pollution. Agricultural activities contaminate water with nitrates, phosphorus, pesticides, soil sediments, salts and pathogens. Pesticides have an adverse impact on health through drinking water. Comparing pesticide use with health life expectancy longitudinal survey data, it was found that a 10% increase in pesticide use resulted in a 1% increase in the medical disability index over 65 years of age. Fluoride contamination of fresh water also affects large parts of rural India. More than 25 million people across 17 states have to drink water with fluoride concentrations higher than the maximum permissible limit of 1.5 parts per million. Excess fluoride can cause a condition called skeletal fluorosis.",
    description4: `Apart from industrialization and agricultural activities, one of the major causes of water pollution is insufficient water supply and sewage treatment facilities. It has been reported that poor water quality and the lack of adequate disposal of human, animal, and household wastes are contributing to waterborne diseases. Just 30% of waste water from India's cities is treated before disposal. The rest flows into rivers, lakes, and groundwater. Figures from India's Central Bureau of Health Intelligence show that the incidence of diarrhea, enteric fever, viral hepatitis, and cholera has stayed at the same level over the past decade.`,
    description5:
      "Polluted and contaminated water usage has severe human health implications. Contaminated water carries pathogens that results in the prevalence of water borne diseases. India struggles with the burden of water borne disease all over the country like diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis infections, cholera and typhoid. Prolonged use of polluted water has also been linked to various forms cancers. It also causes skin ailments like scabies and eye infections like trachoma which can even lead to visual impairment. Excessive bacteria in seawater and heavy metals in drinking water are the main pathogenic factors of skin diseases. 21 percent of annual deaths among children aged less than five years account to diarrhea, with the failure to improve personal and home hygiene as a factor. Infectious agents associated with diarrhea are directly linked to polluted water. The interventions to improve water quality are required to thwart the transmission of diarrheal pathogens from the environment to humans. A study from rural India showed that children living in households with tap water had significantly lower disease prevalence and duration",
    description6:
      "The level of arsenic in drinking water directly affects the health of people, and skin disease is the most common clinical complication of arsenic poisoning. Rural India suffers the most from arsenic and fluoride contaminated water that pose severe health concerns with poor healthcare facility. These pollutants are also associated with various forms of human cancers. Arsenic, nitrate, chromium, etc. are highly associated with cancer. Ingestion of arsenic from drinking water can cause skin cancer and kidney and bladder cancer. Nitrates are a broader contaminant that is more closely associated with human cancers, especially colorectal cancer. Drinking water with high chromium content has the potential to cause human respiratory cancer.",
    description7:
      "The intensity of industrial organic water pollution is positively correlated with infant mortality and child mortality in India, and industrial water pollution is an important cause of infant and child mortality in less developed countries including India. Water pollution can pose health risks to humans through the source of drinking water, the treatment of drinking water and the delivery of drinking water.",
    description8:
      "There is a pressing need to adopt corresponding water management policies to reduce the harm caused by water pollution to human health. Interventions including, chlorination, safe storage of drinking water, provision of treated and clean water, regular water quality checks, as well as limiting, preventing and controlling the source of pollutants from production, consumption and transportation is required to reduce water borne diseases risk in humans. There is also a need to spread awareness in rural regions and to provide them with information as well as accessibility to various government funded mission and yojanas for the prevention and control of water borne diseases in India. In addition to giving health and environmental education, people should also be educated on sanitary water in rural India to enhance public health awareness. Farmers should be trained to avoid overuse of agricultural chemicals that contaminate drinking water.",
    description9:
      'The government of India in 2019 had envisioned and announced the “Jal Jeevan Mission”. It aimed to provide safe and adequate drinking tap water to households nationwide by 2024. The government of India has taken the initiative for groundwater management and conservation by launching the “Atal Bhujal Yojana” programme with assistance from the World Bank and the "Pani Bachao Pani Kamao” programme in Punjab.',

      "An Alarming Surge in the Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in India!",
    description1: `The escalating burden of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in India threatens its population with it being the leading cause of deaths in recent years. It is reported that NCDs led to 66% of deaths in India in the year 2019, further revealing that that there was a 22% probability of death between the age of 30 and 70 due to any type of non-communicable disease, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Exacerbating this problem are the issues of multiple chronic conditions and the fact many remain undiagnosed due to the lack of awareness and accessibility. In India where infectious and parasitic diseases still pose substantial challenges to the public health system, rise in NCDs double the global burden of diseases. The most prevalent NCDs in India are cardiovascular or heart diseases, cerebro-vascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, cancers (cervical, breast, and oral), chronic respiratory diseases, like asthma. These diseases involve high health care demand and are highly priced especially in low resource settings. Therefore, NCDs are one of the major challenges for public health in 21st century, not only in terms of human sufferings but also the burden they impose on the socioeconomic development of the country.`,
    description2:
      "According to a study, India has 101 million people with diabetes, 136 million people with pre-diabetes, 315 million people with high blood pressure, 254 million with generalized obesity, 351 million with abdominal obesity, 213 million people with hypercholesterolaemia and 185 million with high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This data suggests that not only the urban population is associated with these diseases, but then a large scale population is affected by these posing threats to, particularly, the rural regions where there is lack of awareness as well as ease of access to receive government funded healthcare services.",
    description3:
      "The four major NCDs, i.e., cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes are also associated with lifestyle and behavioral factors. The NCDs may occur due to lifestyle as well as genetic factors. They are also termed as lifestyle diseases because the risk factors for NCDs involve poor/unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, inadequate sleep, tobacco, alcohol consumption and stress contributing to hypertension, diabetes, abnormal blood lipids and cholesterol that causes dyslipidaemia and obesity. There are also other risk factors like environmental factors, factors of medical conditions, and socio-demographic factors. Air and water pollution is also a leading risk factor for NCDs in terms of both outdoor air pollution and household air pollution that mainly results from burning solid fuels in the home for cooking and heat and lack of safe drinking water especially in the rural areas.",
    description4:
      "Spreading western lifestyle in low and middle-income countries, due to global population aging and commercial pressures for unhealthy diets and cigarettes, contributes to the increasing rate of NCDs in these countries. There is a direct relationship between poor health and low-income, which contributes to food poverty, purchasing of cheaper and unhealthy dietary products, and expensive treatments, in addition to psychosocial factors. There is a growing trend to consider social, political, and economic systems as critical factors that impact NCDs besides individual behavior and lifestyle.",
    description5:
      "While the cardiovascular diseases can be controlled and prevented by avoiding the risk factors like healthy diets, regular physical activity, avoiding tobacco consumption and smoking, reaching and maintaining a healthy weight, and keeping blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels under control cancer is associated with a number of risk factors and causes. However, the most common type of cancer, i.e., lung cancer is mainly the result of smoking and the risk increases in heavy smokers. Hence studies reveal that it is possible to prevent lung cancer by stopping the prevalence of smoking and by increasing fruit and vegetable consumption. Chronic Respiratory Diseases include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), occupational lung diseases, asthma and respiratory allergies, sleep apnoea syndrome, and pulmonary hypertension. Asthma and COPD account for most of the deaths in low and middle-income communities. These are not fully reversible and are partially preventable, thus following a healthy lifestyle in the early ages of life, avoiding respiratory infections, and avoiding environmental and occupational agents can effectively prevent Chronic Respiratory Diseases. Preventing exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants can be achieved by filtration and ventilation, in addition to the use of natural gas. Diabetes’ prevalence and incidence rates have increased dramatically in the recent years. It is not only a chronic condition, but is also life-threatening. It may cause other serious diseases such as heart diseases, kidney failure, and eye damage, which may subsequently lead to blindness, and foot ulcers, which may require limb amputation. While diabetes can be partially inherited, several lifestyle factors, such as obesity, high sugar consumption, and lack of physical activity can significantly contribute to the progress diabetes. However, lifestyle changes can prevent diabetes and the long-term complications of diabetes. ",
    description6:
      "Since diet is a common risk factor among most NCDs, it attracts more attention in an effort to find effective strategies to provide healthy food to the community and at all stages of life. However, in developing countries like India, interventions to address poverty and economically weaker sections are required apart from controlling various other risk factors. Promotion of healthy diets would need availability of fruits, vegetables, and healthy oils at affordable prices, and reduction of salt, sugar and saturated fats, in processed foods. NCDs are silent killers threatening health without showing any symptoms until the problem progresses to an advanced stage. Patients with NCDs, or people with susceptibility to develop one need long-term care that is personalized, proactive, and sustainable. Primary health care must deliver healthcare strategies to manage NCDs in each community and to detect diseases at early stages. Early detection and prevention of NCDs is a key to control and manage them in a more efficient manner. Health services must gear up capacity for early detection and treatment of NCDs and risk factors in primary healthcare, so that NCDs and their complications can be prevented and early therapy can be initiated when they do occur. At higher levels of care, more advanced diagnostic tests and treatments must become available at affordable cost.",
    description7:
      "The epidemic of these diseases cannot be controlled simply through providing treatment facilities; there is a pressing need to take preventive measures by addressing root causes and spreading awareness about it. Reducing the major risk factors for NCDs is crucial to prevent morbidities and mortalities from NCDs. In line with Sustainable Development Goal, the global ambition is to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one-third by 2030. The Indian government has rebranded and expanded the National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke (NPCDCS) into the NP-NCD, broadening its scope to include Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Asthma, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).",

    description1: `India's education system, one of the largest in the world, is undergoing a transformative phase in 2024. While there have been significant strides in improving access and quality, challenges persist in bridging gaps and meeting the demands of a rapidly changing world. Let’s explore the key elements shaping the education landscape in India today.`,
    description2:
      "The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 continues to be the cornerstone of educational reforms in India. The policy focuses on making education more inclusive, holistic, and aligned with global standards. A key feature of NEP is its emphasis on early childhood education, multilingualism, and flexible learning paths. The shift from rote learning to competency-based education aims to foster critical thinking and creativity among students. By introducing a 5+3+3+4 structure, NEP envisions a comprehensive approach to learning, where foundational skills are prioritized early on. One of the most profound changes in Indian education has been the integration of digital learning. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of online education, which continues to thrive even in the post-pandemic world. EdTech platforms have revolutionized how students learn, offering personalized learning experiences at the click of a button.",
    description3:
      "Government initiatives such as SWAYAM and DIKSHA aim to provide quality online education and digital resources to students across the country. However, despite these advancements, digital inequality remains a significant concern. Students in rural areas often struggle with access to high-speed internet and modern devices, which hinders their participation in the digital education revolution.",

    description4:
      "Although India has made impressive progress in enrollment rates, the quality of education remains inconsistent, especially in rural areas. Government schools often lack adequate infrastructure, and there is a shortage of well-trained teachers. Teacher quality continues to be a bottleneck, and while the NEP focuses on teacher training, there is still a long way to go before standards are uniformly high across the nation.",
    description5:
      "Moreover, dropout rates remain high, particularly among students in the secondary and higher secondary levels. Financial constraints, socio-economic factors, and the lack of quality education options are some of the main reasons why students leave school prematurely. Programs like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao and Mid-Day Meal Scheme aim to improve enrollment and retention, but challenges related to gender inequality and regional disparities remain.",

    description6:
      "In response to the growing demand for skilled labor, India’s education system is increasingly focusing on vocational training. The introduction of vocational education courses at the school and college levels, alongside the promotion of Skill India initiatives, aims to better align education with industry requirements. However, skill-based education is still often seen as inferior to academic education, which continues to hinder the expansion of vocational training opportunities.",
    description7:
      "India’s higher education sector is also evolving, with more institutions offering specialized programs in fields like Biotechnology, medicine, and business. The internationalization of Indian higher education is gaining momentum, with Indian universities collaborating with top global institutions. The government’s Study in India initiative aims to attract international students and position India as a global education hub. However, India’s higher education system still faces challenges like limited research output and the need for greater investment in infrastructure and innovation.The rise of private schools and universities, especially in urban areas, has added a new dimension to the education sector. While these institutions often offer better infrastructure and facilities, they also contribute to growing educational inequality. Many private institutions cater to the elite, leaving students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds with limited options. India’s education system in 2024 is marked by ongoing reform, digital transformation, and a focus on quality improvement. While initiatives like the NEP 2020 and digital learning are promising, challenges such as inequality, teacher shortages, and infrastructure deficits continue to hinder the full realization of educational goals. The need for further investment in both physical and human resources remains critical to creating an education system that is equitable, accessible, and globally competitive.",

It is reported that NCDs led to 66% of deaths in India in the year 2019, further revealing that that there was a 22% probability of death between the age of 30 and 70 due to any type of non-communicable disease, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Exacerbating this problem are the issues of multiple chronic conditions and the fact many remain undiagnosed due to the lack of awareness and accessibility. In India where infectious and parasitic diseases still pose substantial challenges to the public health system, rise in NCDs double the global burden of diseases. The most prevalent NCDs in India are cardiovascular or heart diseases, cerebro-vascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, cancers (cervical, breast, and oral), chronic respiratory diseases, like asthma. These diseases involve high health care demand and are highly priced especially in low resource settings. Therefore, NCDs are one of the major challenges for public health in 21st century, not only in terms of human sufferings but also the burden they impose on the socioeconomic development of the country.`,

This data suggests that not only the urban population is associated with these diseases, but then a large scale population is affected by these posing threats to, particularly, the rural regions where there is lack of awareness as well as ease of access to receive government funded healthcare services.",
  //   description3:
  //     "The four major NCDs, i.e., cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes are also associated with lifestyle and behavioral factors. The NCDs may occur due to lifestyle as well as genetic factors. They are also termed as lifestyle diseases because the risk factors for NCDs involve poor/unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, inadequate sleep, tobacco, alcohol consumption and stress contributing to hypertension, diabetes, abnormal blood lipids and cholesterol that causes dyslipidaemia and obesity. There are also other risk factors like environmental factors, factors of medical conditions, and socio-demographic factors. Air and water pollution is also a leading risk factor for NCDs in terms of both outdoor air pollution and household air pollution that mainly results from burning solid fuels in the home for cooking and heat and lack of safe drinking water especially in the rural areas.",

  //     "Spreading western lifestyle in low and middle-income countries, due to global population aging and commercial pressures for unhealthy diets and cigarettes, contributes to the increasing rate of NCDs in these countries. There is a direct relationship between poor health and low-income, which contributes to food poverty, purchasing of cheaper and unhealthy dietary products, and expensive treatments, in addition to psychosocial factors. There is a growing trend to consider social, political, and economic systems as critical factors that impact NCDs besides individual behavior and lifestyle.",

However, the most common type of cancer, i.e., lung cancer is mainly the result of smoking and the risk increases in heavy smokers. Hence studies reveal that it is possible to prevent lung cancer by stopping the prevalence of smoking and by increasing fruit and vegetable consumption. Chronic Respiratory Diseases include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), occupational lung diseases, asthma and respiratory allergies, sleep apnoea syndrome, and pulmonary hypertension. Asthma and COPD account for most of the deaths in low and middle-income communities. These are not fully reversible and are partially preventable, thus following a healthy lifestyle in the early ages of life, avoiding respiratory infections, and avoiding environmental and occupational agents can effectively prevent Chronic Respiratory Diseases. Preventing exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants can be achieved by filtration and ventilation, in addition to the use of natural gas. Diabetes’ prevalence and incidence rates have increased dramatically in the recent years. It is not only a chronic condition, but is also life-threatening. It may cause other serious diseases such as heart diseases, kidney failure, and eye damage, which may subsequently lead to blindness, and foot ulcers, which may require limb amputation.

Promotion of healthy diets would need availability of fruits, vegetables, and healthy oils at affordable prices, and reduction of salt, sugar and saturated fats, in processed foods. NCDs are silent killers threatening health without showing any symptoms until the problem progresses to an advanced stage.

      description1: `In 2024, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept – it’s becoming an integral part of the education system, transforming how we learn, teach, and engage with knowledge. From personalized learning to administrative automation, AI is reshaping the educational landscape, offering promising new opportunities, yet presenting challenges that need to be addressed.`,
      description2:
        "One of the most exciting aspects of AI in education is its ability to create personalized learning experiences. Traditional education systems often use a one-size-fits-all approach, which can leave some students behind while others are under-stimulated. AI, however, allows for learning platforms and tools to adapt to each student’s needs, adjusting the pace and style of content delivery based on real-time feedback.",
      description3:
        "AI-powered platforms like intelligent tutoring systems can identify the areas where a student struggles, offering customized exercises and feedback to improve their understanding. This adaptive learning makes education more effective, helping students to learn at their own pace, while also ensuring that advanced learners are challenged.",
      description4:
        `For educators, AI isn’t about replacing teachers – it’s about enhancing their capabilities. Administrative tasks such as grading assignments, creating lesson plans, and monitoring student performance can be time-consuming. AI can streamline these tasks, freeing up valuable time for teachers to focus on direct interaction with students.`,
      description5:
        `AI-driven tools like chatbots and virtual teaching assistants can help answer routine questions, guide students through homework, and provide additional learning resources, offering personalized support at any time of the day. This creates a more efficient learning environment, where students feel supported and teachers can dedicate more time to creative, interactive teaching.`,
      description6:
        "AI is also revolutionizing the way we assess student performance. Traditional assessments often fail to measure a student’s true understanding of a topic, relying on standardized tests that may not reflect real-world skills. AI, however, can create dynamic assessments that evolve with the student’s learning journey, offering continuous feedback and identifying areas of improvement.",
      description7:
        `Moreover, AI can reduce bias in grading, ensuring that assessments are fair and objective. Tools like AI-powered plagiarism checkers and automated essay grading systems can make evaluations quicker and more accurate.
  Preparing Students for the Future Workforce.`,
  description8:`As AI continues to shape industries worldwide, it’s essential that students learn to work alongside this technology. In addition to using AI-powered tools, students need to develop the critical thinking, problem-solving, and technical skills required to thrive in an AI-driven world.
  Integrating AI into the curriculum allows students to not only engage with the technology but also understand its potential and limitations. It’s no longer enough to simply use AI; the future workforce will need to innovate with it. This means preparing students for careers in fields like AI development, data analysis, and ethical AI deployment.`,
  description9:`Despite its many benefits, AI in education raises important ethical issues. The data AI systems collect can reveal a lot about student behaviors, learning patterns, and even personal information. This raises concerns about privacy, data security, and the potential misuse of sensitive information.
  Moreover, there is the question of bias. AI systems learn from data, and if that data is biased, AI can perpetuate or even amplify these biases. Ensuring that AI tools are transparent, accountable, and ethically designed is crucial to preventing harm.
  The rise of Artificial Intelligence in education is a game-changer. AI has the potential to make education more personalized, efficient, and accessible than ever before. For teachers, it offers support and innovation, while for students, it provides a more dynamic and tailored learning experience.
  However, as AI continues to play a larger role, it is essential to address challenges related to ethics, data privacy, and equitable access to technology. By harnessing AI’s full potential and using it responsibly, we can shape an education system that prepares future generations for success in an increasingly digital and automated world.
  AI in education isn’t just about technology – it’s about creating an environment where both students and educators can thrive in a world of endless possibilities.

In 2024, AI is more than just a futuristic tool—it's an integral part of modern medicine, helping healthcare professionals save lives and improve patient outcomes. From early diagnosis to personalized treatments and improving operational efficiency, AI is transforming healthcare in ways that were once unimaginable.`,
      description2:
        "AI’s ability to detect diseases at early stages is one of its most powerful applications. Machine learning algorithms can analyze medical images, genetic data, and patient histories to identify signs of conditions like cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders—often before symptoms even appear. For example, AI algorithms trained on thousands of medical images can detect tumors in mammograms or CT scans with greater precision than the human eye. Early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment, saving countless lives.",
      description3:
        "AI is also changing the way doctors create treatment plans. By analyzing a patient's genetic makeup, lifestyle, and medical history, AI can help doctors devise personalized treatment options. This is particularly beneficial in oncology, where AI is used to tailor chemotherapy regimens based on the genetic profile of both the patient and the cancer cells. This approach minimizes side effects and maximizes the efficacy of treatment, improving the patient's quality of life and survival chances.",

        "The Future of Personalized Medicine: Tailoring Treatment to Your DNA",
      description1: `In recent years, personalized medicine has emerged as a game-changer in healthcare, offering treatments and strategies tailored to the unique genetic makeup of each patient. Rather than relying on a “one-size-fits-all” approach, personalized medicine uses genetic information, lifestyle factors, and environmental influences to customize healthcare interventions. This shift is transforming how we diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases, paving the way for a more precise and effective healthcare system.`,
      description2:
        "At the core of personalized medicine is genomic data, which holds the blueprint of a person’s health. By analyzing a patient’s DNA, scientists can identify genetic mutations that influence disease susceptibility, drug responses, and treatment effectiveness. Genetic sequencing allows healthcare providers to tailor interventions that are specifically suited to the individual, minimizing the risk of side effects and maximizing treatment success. For example, a patient’s genetic profile can help determine the best cancer treatment or pinpoint the optimal dosage of a medication.",
      description3:
        "One of the most impactful applications of personalized medicine is in cancer treatment. Traditional treatments like chemotherapy and radiation are often generalized and can harm healthy cells, leading to severe side effects. However, through genomic testing, doctors can identify the specific mutations driving a patient’s cancer and select targeted therapies that focus on those mutations. Drugs like Herceptin for breast cancer or Gleevec for leukemia are examples of targeted therapies that are more effective and less damaging than traditional treatments, improving the likelihood of survival and reducing side effects.",
      description4:
        "Personalized medicine is also revolutionizing the field of pharmacogenomics, which studies how genes affect a person’s response to drugs. By understanding genetic variations, doctors can predict how patients will metabolize medications. This enables the customization of prescriptions, ensuring the right drug and dosage for each individual. For example, some patients may metabolize certain blood thinners or antidepressants too quickly or too slowly, increasing the risk of adverse effects. With genetic insights, these risks can be mitigated, leading to more effective and safer treatments.",
      description5:
        "Another exciting aspect of personalized medicine is its potential for disease prevention. Genetic testing allows individuals to assess their risk for conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s. By identifying genetic predispositions, doctors can recommend early interventions such as lifestyle changes, preventive medications, or regular screenings, all of which can reduce the risk of developing these conditions. For example, women with mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are at a higher risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Knowing this in advance allows them to take preventive steps, such as increased screening or even preventive surgery, to lower their risk. ",
      description6:
        "Gene therapy, one of the most groundbreaking aspects of personalized medicine, offers the possibility of curing genetic disorders by directly altering a patient’s DNA. Technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 are enabling scientists to target and edit defective genes at the molecular level, potentially offering cures for conditions like sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and muscular dystrophy. While still in its early stages, gene therapy holds the promise of completely altering the treatment landscape for genetic diseases, offering patients the potential for long-term, even permanent, cures.",
      description7:
       "Despite its immense promise, personalized medicine does face challenges. The cost of genetic testing and customized treatments can be prohibitive, making it inaccessible to some populations. Additionally, ethical concerns regarding genetic privacy and data security must be addressed to ensure that individuals’ genetic information is protected from misuse. It is essential to create frameworks that allow the benefits of personalized medicine to be available to all, regardless of income or background.",
      description8:`As we look toward the future, personalized medicine is poised to revolutionize healthcare by offering more effective, efficient, and precise treatments. With advancements in genomics, pharmacogenomics, and gene therapy, patients will experience healthcare that is truly customized to their individual genetic needs.
